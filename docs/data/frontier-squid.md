# Install the Frontier Squid HTTP Caching Proxy

Frontier Squid is a distribution of the well-known [squid HTTP caching
proxy software](http://squid-cache.org) that is optimized for use with
applications on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). It has
[many advantages](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Why_use_frontier_squid_instead_o)
over regular squid for common grid applications, especially Frontier
and CVMFS. The OSG distribution of frontier-squid is a straight rebuild of the
upstream frontier-squid package for the convenience of OSG users.

This document is intended for System Administrators who are installing
`frontier-squid`, the OSG distribution of the Frontier Squid software.

!!! note "Applicable versions"
    This document applies to software from the OSG 3.4 Release Series.
    The version of frontier-squid installed should be >= 3.5.24-3.1.
    When using OSG software from a previous Release Series (eg, OSG 3.3)
    and a frontier-squid version in the 2.7STABLE9 series, refer to the
    [old upstream install documentation](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/OldInstallSquid)
    instead of the current links included below. There are some
    incompatibilities between the two versions of frontier-squid, so if you
    are upgrading from a 2.7STABLE9 version to a 3.5 version, see the
    [upstream documentation on upgrading](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Upgrading).

## Frontier Squid Is Recommended

OSG recommends that all sites run a caching proxy for HTTP and HTTPS
to help reduce bandwidth and improve throughput. To that end, Compute
Element (CE) installations include Frontier Squid automatically. We
encourage all sites to configure and use this service, as described
below.

For large sites that expect heavy load on the proxy, it is best to run the proxy on its own host.
If you are unsure if your site qualifies, we recommend initially running the proxy on your CE host and monitoring its
bandwidth.
If the network usage regularly peaks at over one third of the bandwidth capacity, move the proxy to a new host.

## Before Starting

Before starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting [the Reference section below](#reference) as needed):

-   **User IDs:** If it does not exist already, the installation will create the `squid` Linux user
-   **Network ports:** Frontier squid communicates on ports 3128 (TCP) and 3401 (UDP)
-   **Host choice:** If you will be supporting the Frontier application at your site, review the
[upstream documentation](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Hardware) to determine how to size your equipment.

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

- Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](../release/supported_platforms)
- Obtain root access to the host
- Prepare the [required Yum repositories](../common/yum)

### Installing Frontier Squid

To install Frontier Squid, make sure that your host is up to date before installing the required packages:

1. Clean yum cache:

        ::console
        root@host # yum clean all --enablerepo=*

2. Update software:

        :::console
        root@host # yum update

    This command will update **all** packages

3. Install Frontier Squid:

        :::console
        root@host # yum install frontier-squid
        
## Configuring Frontier Squid

### Configuring the Frontier Squid Service

To configure the Frontier Squid service itself:

1.  Follow the
    [Configuration section of the upstream Frontier Squid documentation](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Configuration).
2.  Enable, start, and test the service (as described below).
3.  [Register the squid](#registering-frontier-squid).
4.  If your site is part of the WLCG, enable WLCG monitoring as described in the
    [upstream documentation on enabling monitoring](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Enabling_monitoring).

!!! Note
    An important difference between the standard Squid software and
    the Frontier Squid variant is that Frontier Squid changes are in
    `/etc/squid/customize.sh` instead of `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.

### Configuring the OSG CE

To configure the OSG Compute Element (CE) to know about your Frontier Squid service:

1.  On your CE host (which may be different than your Frontier Squid host), edit `/etc/osg/config.d/01-squid.ini`
    -   Make sure that `enabled` is set to `True`
    -   Set `location` to the hostname and port of your Frontier Squid
        service (e.g., `my.squid.host.edu:3128`)
    -   Leave the other settings at `DEFAULT` unless you have specific
        reasons to change them

2.  Run `osg-configure -c` to propagate the changes on your CE.

!!! Note
    You may want to finish other CE configuration tasks before running
    `osg-configure`. Just be sure to run it once before starting CE
    services.

## Using Frontier-Squid

Start the frontier-squid service and enable it to start at boot time. As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as `root`):

| To...                                   | On EL6, run the command...                  | On EL7, run the command...                      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------   | :--------------------------------------------   |
| Start a service                         | `service frontier-squid start` | `systemctl start frontier-squid`   |
| Stop a  service                         | `service frontier-squid stop`  | `systemctl stop frontier-squid`    |
| Enable a service to start on boot       | `chkconfig frontier-squid on`  | `systemctl enable frontier-squid`  |
| Disable a service from starting on boot | `chkconfig frontier-squid off` | `systemctl disable frontier-squid` |

## Validating Frontier Squid

As any user on another computer, do the following (where
`%RED%my.squid.host.edu%ENDCOLOR%` is the fully qualified domain name of your
squid server):

``` console
user@host $ export http_proxy=http://%RED%my.squid.host.edu%ENDCOLOR%:3128
user@host $ wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch 2>&1|grep X-Cache
X-Cache: MISS from %RED%my.squid.host.edu%ENDCOLOR%
user@host $ wget -qdO/dev/null http://frontier.cern.ch 2>&1|grep X-Cache
X-Cache: HIT from %RED%my.squid.host.edu%ENDCOLOR%
```

If the grep doesn't print anything, try removing it from the pipeline
to see if errors are obvious. If the second try says MISS again,
something is probably wrong with the squid cache writes. Look at the squid
[access.log file](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Log_file_contents)
to try to see what's wrong.

If your squid will be supporting the Frontier application, it is also
good to do the test in the
[upstream documentation Testing the installation section](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Testing_the_installation).

## Registering Frontier Squid

To register your Frontier Squid host, follow the general registration instructions
[here](/common/registration#new-resources) with the following Frontier Squid-specific details:

1.  Add a `Squid:` section to the `Services:` list, with any relevant fields for that service.
    This is a partial example:

        :::console
        ...
        FQDN: <FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME>
        Services:
          Squid:
            Description: Generic squid service
        ...

    Replacing `<FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME>` with your Frontier Squid server's DNS entry or in the case of multiple
    Frontier Squid servers for a single resource, the round-robin DNS entry.

    See the [BNL_ATLAS_Frontier_Squid](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/80e482279b10c7b13fc7688c71833c14ebdc1b50/topology/Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory/Brookhaven%20ATLAS%20Tier1/BNL-ATLAS.yaml#L298-L318) 
    for a complete example.

2.  If you are setting up a new resource, set `Active: false`.
    Only set `Active: true` for a resource when it is accepting requests and ready for production.

If you are running a WLCG site, a few hours after a squid is registered
and marked `Active`, 
[verify that it is monitored by WLCG](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/WLCGSquidRegistration#Verify_monitor).
