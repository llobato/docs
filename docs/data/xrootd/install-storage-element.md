Installing and Maintaining XRootD
=================================

[XRootD](http://xrootd.org/) is a hierarchical storage system that can be used in a variety of ways to access data,
typically distributed among actual storage resources. 
One way to use XRootD is to have it refer to many data resources at a single site, and another way to use it is to refer
to many storage systems, most likely distributed among sites.  An XRootD system includes a *redirector*, which accepts
requests for data and finds a storage repository — locally or
otherwise — that can provide the data to the requestor.

Use this page to learn how to install, configure, and use an XRootD redirector as part of a Storage Element (SE) or as
part of a global namespace.

Before Starting
---------------

Before starting the installation process, consider the following points:

-   **User IDs:** If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID `xrootd`
-   **Service certificate:** The XRootD service uses a host certificate at `/etc/grid-security/host*.pem`
-   **Networking:** The XRootD service uses port 1094 by default

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

-   Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](/release/supported_platforms)
-   Obtain root access to the host
-   Prepare [the required Yum repositories](/common/yum)
-   Install [CA certificates](/common/ca)

Installing an XRootD Server
---------------------------

An installation of the XRootD server consists of the server itself and its dependencies. 
Install these with Yum:

``` console
root@host # yum install xrootd
```

Configuring an XRootD Server
----------------------------

### Minimal configuration

A new installation of XRootD is already configured to run a standalone server that serves files from `/tmp` on the local
file system. 
This configuration is useful to verify basic connectivity between your clients and your server. 
To do this, start the `xrootd` service with standalone config as described in the [managing services
section](#managing-xrootd-services).

You should be able now to copy a file such as `/bin/sh` using `xrdcp` command into `/tmp`. 
To test, do:

``` console
root@host # yum install xrootd-client
root@host # xrdcp /bin/sh root://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test
[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]
root@host # ls -l /tmp/first_test
-rw-r--r-- 1 xrootd xrootd 801512 Apr 11 10:48 /tmp/first_test
```

Other than for testing, a standalone server is useful when you want to serve files off of a single host with lots of
large disks. 
If your storage capacity is spread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an XRootD cluster.

### Advanced configuration

An advanced XRootD setup has multiple components; it is important to validate that each additional component that you
set up is working before moving on to the next component. 
We have included validation instructions after each component below.

### Creating an XRootD cluster

![XRootD cluster](/img/xrootd.jpg)

If your storage is spread out over multiple hosts, you will need to set up an XRootD *cluster*. 
The cluster uses one "redirector" node as a frontend for user accesses, and multiple data nodes that have the data that
users request. 
Two daemons will run on each node:

`xrootd`<br/>
The eXtended Root Daemon controls file access and storage.

`cmsd`<br/>
The Cluster Management Services Daemon controls communication between nodes.

Note that for large virtual organizations, a site-level redirector may actually also communicate upwards to a regional
or global redirector that handles access to a multi-level hierarchy. 
This section will only cover handling one level of XRootD hierarchy.

In the instructions below, %RED%RDRNODE%ENDCOLOR% will refer to the redirector host and %RED%DATANODE%ENDCOLOR% will
refer to the data node host. 
These should be replaced with the fully-qualified domain name of the host in question.

#### Modify /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg

You will need to modify the `xrootd-clustered.cfg` on the redirector node and each data node. 
The following example should serve as a base configuration for clustering. Further customizations are detailed below.

``` file
all.export %RED%/tmp%ENDCOLOR% stage
set xrdr = %RED%RDRNODE%ENDCOLOR%
all.manager $(xrdr):3121

if $(xrdr)
  # Lines in this block are only executed on the redirector node
  all.role manager
else
  # Lines in this block are executed on all nodes but the redirector node
  all.role server
  cms.space min %RED%2g 5g%ENDCOLOR%
fi
```

You will need to customize the following lines:

| Configuration Line                     | Changes Needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:---------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `all.export %RED%/tmp%ENDCOLOR% stage` | Change `/tmp` to the directory to allow XRootD access to                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `set xrdr=%RED%RDRNODE%ENDCOLOR%`      | Change to the hostname of the redirector                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `cms.space min %RED%2g 5g%ENDCOLOR%`   | Reserve this amount of free space on the node. For this example, if space falls below 2GB, xrootd will not store further files on this node until space climbs above 5GB. You can use `k`, `m`, `g`, or `t` to indicate kilobyte, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, respectively. |

Further information can be found at <http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc>

#### Verifying the clustered config

Start both `xrootd` and `cmsd` on all nodes according to the instructions in the [managing services
section](#ManagingServices).

Verify that you can copy a file such as `/bin/sh` to `/tmp` on the server data via the redirector:

``` console
root@host # xrdcp /bin/sh  root://%RED%RDRNODE%ENDCOLOR%:1094///tmp/second_test
[xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]
```

Check that the `/tmp/second_test` is located on data server %RED%DATANODE%ENDCOLOR%.

### (Optional) Adding Simple Server Inventory to your cluster

The Simple Server Inventory (SSI) provide means to have an inventory for each data server. 
SSI requires:

-   A second instance of the `xrootd` daemon on the redirector
-   A "composite name space daemon" (`XrdCnsd`) on each data server; this daemon handles the inventory

As an example, we will set up a two-node XRootD cluster with SSI.

Host A is a redirector node that is running the following daemons:

1.  xrootd redirector
2.  cmsd
3.  xrootd - second instance that required for SSI

Host B is a data server that is running the following daemons:

1.  xrootd data server
2.  cmsd
3.  XrdCnsd - started automatically by xrootd

We will need to create a directory on the redirector node for Inventory files.

``` console
root@host # mkdir -p /data/inventory
root@host # chown xrootd:xrootd /data/inventory
```

On the data server (host B) let's use a storage cache that will be at a different location from `/tmp`. 

``` console
root@host # mkdir -p  /local/xrootd
root@host # chown xrootd:xrootd /local/xrootd
```

We will be running two instances of XRootD on %RED%hostA%ENDCOLOR%. 
Modify `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg` to give the two instances different behavior, as such:

``` file
all.export /data/xrootdfs
set xrdr=%RED%hostA%ENDCOLOR%
all.manager $(xrdr):3121
if $(xrdr) && named cns
      all.export /data/inventory
      xrd.port 1095
else if $(xrdr)
      all.role manager
      xrd.port 1094
else
      all.role server
      oss.localroot /local/xrootd
      ofs.notify closew create mkdir mv rm rmdir trunc | /usr/bin/XrdCnsd -d -D 2 -i 90 -b $(xrdr):1095:/data/inventory
      #add cms.space if you have less the 11GB
      # cms.space options http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev/cms_config.htm
      cms.space min 2g 5g
fi
```

The value of `oss.localroot` will be prepended to any file access.  
E.g. accessing `root://%RED%RDRNODE%ENDCOLOR%:1094//data/xrootdfs/test1` will actually go to
`/local/xrootd/data/xrootdfs/test1`.

#### Starting a second instance of XRootD on EL 6

The procedure for starting a second instance differs between EL 6 and EL 7. 
This section is the procedure for EL 6.

Now, we have to change `/etc/sysconfig/xrootd` on the redirector node (%RED%hostA%ENDCOLOR%) to run multiple instances
of XRootD. 
The second instance of XRootD will be named "cns" and will be used for SSI.

```file
XROOTD_USER=xrootd 
XROOTD_GROUP=xrootd 
XROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="%RED%-k 7%ENDCOLOR% -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg"
%RED%XROOTD_CNS_OPTIONS="-k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg"%ENDCOLOR% 
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="%RED%-k 7%ENDCOLOR% -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg" 
FRMD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="%RED%-k 7%ENDCOLOR% -l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg" 
%RED%XROOTD_INSTANCES="default cns"%ENDCOLOR% 
CMSD_INSTANCES="default" 
FRMD_INSTANCES="default" 
```

Now, we can start XRootD cluster executing the following commands. 
On redirector you will see:

```console
root@host # service xrootd start 
Starting xrootd (xrootd, default): %GREEN%[ OK ]%ENDCOLOR% 
Starting xrootd (xrootd, cns): %GREEN%[ OK ]%ENDCOLOR% 
root@host # service cmsd start 
Starting xrootd (cmsd, default): %GREEN%[ OK ]%ENDCOLOR% 
```

On redirector node you should see two instances of xrootd running:

```console
root@host # ps auxww|grep xrootd
xrootd 29036 0.0 0.0 44008 3172 ? Sl Apr11 0:00 /usr/bin/xrootd -k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -b -s /var/run/xrootd/xrootd-default.pid -n default
xrootd 29108 0.0 0.0 43868 3016 ? Sl Apr11 0:00 /usr/bin/xrootd -k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -b -s /var/run/xrootd/xrootd-cns.pid -n cns
xrootd 29196 0.0 0.0 51420 3692 ? Sl Apr11 0:00 /usr/bin/cmsd -k 7 -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -b -s /var/run/xrootd/cmsd-default.pid -n default
```
%RED%Warning%ENDCOLOR% the log file for second named instance of xrootd with be
placed in `/var/log/xrootd/cns/xrootd.log`

On data server node you should that XrdCnsd process has been started:

```console
root@host # ps auxww|grep xrootd
xrootd 19156 0.0 0.0 48096 3256 ? Sl 07:37 0:00 /usr/bin/cmsd -l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -b -s /var/run/xrootd/cmsd-default.pid -n default
xrootd 19880 0.0 0.0 46124 2916 ? Sl 08:33 0:00 /usr/bin/xrootd -l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -b -s /var/run/xrootd/xrootd-default.pid -n default
xrootd 19894 0.0 0.1 71164 6960 ? Sl 08:33 0:00 /usr/bin/XrdCnsd -d -D 2 -i 90 -b fermicloud053.fnal.gov:1095:/data/inventory
```

#### Starting a second instance of XRootD on EL 7

The procedure for starting a second instance differs between EL 6 and EL 7. 
This section is the procedure for EL 7.

1.  Create a symlink pointing to `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg` at `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-cns.cfg`:

```console
root@host # ln -s /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg /etc/xrootd/xrootd-cns.cfg
```

1.  Start an instance of the `xrootd` service named `cns` using the syntax in the [managing services section](#ManagingServices):

```console
root@host # systemctl start xrootd@cns
```

#### Testing an XRootD cluster with SSI

1.  Copy file to redirector node specifying storage path (/data/xrootdfs instead of /tmp):

```console
root@host # xrdcp /bin/sh root://%RED%RDRNODE%ENDCOLOR%:1094//data/xrootdfs/test1 
[xrootd] Total 0.00 MB [================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s] 
```

1.  To verify that SSI is working execute `cns_ssi` command on the redirector node:

```console
root@host # cns_ssi list /data/inventory 
fermicloud054.fnal.gov incomplete inventory as of Mon Apr 11 17:28:11 2011 
root@host # cns_ssi updt /data/inventory 
cns_ssi: fermicloud054.fnal.gov inventory with 1 directory and 1 file updated with 0 errors. 
root@host # cns_ssi list /data/inventory 
fermicloud054.fnal.gov complete inventory as of Tue Apr 12 07:38:29 2011 /data/xrootdfs/test1 
```

**Note**: In this example, `fermicloud53.fnal.gov` is a redirector node and `fermicloud054.fnal.gov` is a data node.

### (Optional) Enabling Xrootd over HTTP

XRootD can be accessed using the HTTP protocol. To do that:

1.   Modify `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg` and add the following lines. You will also need to add the configuration regarding [lcmaps authorization](#security-option-3-xrootd-lcmaps-authorization).

        :::file
           if exec xrootd
            xrd.protocol http:1094 libXrdHttp.so
            http.cadir /etc/grid-security/certificates
            http.cert /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem
            http.key /etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem
            http.secxtractor /usr/lib64/libXrdLcmaps.so
            http.listingdeny yes
            http.staticpreload http://static/robots.txt /etc/xrootd/robots.txt
            http.desthttps yes
           fi
  
1.   Create robots.txt. Add file `/etc/xrootd/robots.txt` with these contents:

        :::file
           User-agent: *
           Disallow: / 

1.   Testing the configuration
    
     From the terminal, generate a proxy and attempt to use davix-get to copy from your XRootD host (the XRootD service needs running; see the [services section](#managing-xrootd-services)).  For example, if your server has a file named `/store/user/test.root`:
   
        :::console
           davix-get https://%RED%yourHostname%ENDCOLOR%:1094/store/user/test.root -E /tmp/x509up_u`id -u` --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates

!!! note
    For clients to successfully read from the regional redirector, HTTPS must be enabled for the data servers and the site-level redirector.

!!! warning
    If you have `u *` in your Authfile, recall this provides an authorization to ALL users, including unauthenticated. This includes random web spiders!

#### (Optional) Enable HTTP based Writes

No changes to the HTTP module is needed to enable HTTP-based writes.  The HTTP protocol uses the same authorization setup as the XRootD protocol.  For example, you may need to provide `a` (all) style authorizations to allow users authorization to write. See the [Authentication File section](##authorization-file) for more details.

### (Optional) Enabling a FUSE mount

XRootD storage can be mounted as a standard POSIX filesystem via FUSE, providing users with a more familiar interface..

Modify `/etc/fstab` by adding the following entries:

    :::file
    ....
    xrootdfs                %RED%/mnt/xrootd%ENDCOLOR%              fuse    rdr=xroot://%RED%redirector1.domain.com%ENDCOLOR%:1094/%RED%/path/%ENDCOLOR%,uid=xrootd 0 0


Replace `/mnt/xrootd` with the path that you would like to access with. 
This should also match the GridFTP settings for the `XROOTD_VMP` local path. 
Create `/mnt/xrootd` directory. Make sure the xrootd user exists on the system. Once you are finished, you can mount it:

    :::file
    mount /mnt/xrootd

You should now be able to run UNIX commands such as `ls /mnt/xrootd` to see the contents of the XRootD server.

### (Optional) Authorization

For information on how to configure xrootd-lcmaps authorization, please refer to the
[Configuring XRootD Authorization guide](xrootd-authorization).

### (Optional) Adding CMS TFC support to XRootD (CMS sites only)

For CMS users, there is a package available to integrate rule-based name lookup using a `storage.xml` file. 
If you are not setting up a CMS site, you can skip this section.

``` console
yum install --enablerepo=osg-contrib xrootd-cmstfc
```

You will need to add your `storage.xml` to `/etc/xrootd/storage.xml` and then add the following line to your XRootD
configuration:

``` file
# Integrate with CMS TFC, placed in /etc/xrootd/storage.xml
oss.namelib /usr/lib64/libXrdCmsTfc.so file:/etc/xrootd/storage.xml%ORANGE%?protocol=hadoop%ENDCOLOR%
```

Add the orange text only if you are running hadoop (see below).

See the CMS TWiki for more information:

-   <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/XrootdTfcChanges>
-   <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/HdfsXrootdInstall>

### (Optional) Adding Hadoop support to XRootD

HDFS-based sites should utilize the `xrootd-hdfs` plugin to allow XRootD to access their storage.

``` console
root@host # yum install xrootd-hdfs
```

You will then need to add the following lines to your
`/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg`:

``` file
xrootd.fslib /usr/lib64/libXrdOfs.so
ofs.osslib /usr/lib64/libXrdHdfs.so
```

For more information, see [the HDFS installation documents](/data/install-hadoop).

### (Optional) Adding File Residency Manager (FRM) to an XRootd cluster

If you have a multi-tiered storage system (e.g. some data is stored on SSDs and some on disks or tapes), then install
the File Residency Manager (FRM), so you can move data between tiers more easily. 
If you do not have a multi-tiered storage system, then you do not need FRM and you can skip this section.

The FRM deals with two major mechanisms:

-   local disk
-   remote servers

The description of fully functional multiple XRootD clusters is beyond the scope of this document. 
In order to have this fully functional system you will need a global redirector and at least one remote XRootD cluster
from where files could be moved to the local cluster.

Below are the modifications you should make in order to enable FRM on your local cluster:

1.  Make sure that FRM is enabled in `/etc/sysconfig/xrootd` on your data sever:

```file
ROOTD_USER=xrootd 
XROOTD_GROUP=xrootd 
XROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg" 
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg" 
FRMD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/frmd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg" 
XROOTD_INSTANCES="default" 
CMSD_INSTANCES="default" 
FRMD_INSTANCES="default"
```

1.  Modify `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg` on both nodes to specify options for `frm_xfrd` (File Transfer Daemon) and `frm_purged` (File Purging Daemon). For more information, you can visit the [FRM Documentation](http://xrootd.org/doc/dev4/frm_config.htm)
2.  Start frm daemons on data server:

```console
root@host # service frm_xfrd start
root@host # service frm_purged start
```

(Optional) Installing a GridFTP Server
--------------------------------------

The Globus GridFTP server can be installed alongside an XRootD storage element to provide GridFTP-based access to the
storage.

!!! note "See Also"
    OSG has extensive documentation on setting up a GridFTP server; this section is an
    abbreviated version documenting the special steps needed for XRootD integration.
    You may also find the following useful:

    -   [Basic GridFTP Install](/data/gridftp).  Additionally covers service planning topics.
    -   [Load-balanced GridFTP Install](/data/load-balanced-gridftp).  Covers the creation of
        a load-balanced GridFTP service using multiple servers.

Prior to following this installation guide, verify the host certificates and networking is configured correctly as in
the [basic GridFTP install](/data/gridftp).

### Installation

GridFTP support for XRootD-based storage is provided by the `osg-gridftp-xrootd` meta-package:

``` console
root@host # yum install osg-gridftp-xrootd
```

### Configuration

For information on how to configure authentication for your GridFTP installation, please refer to the [configuring
authentication section of the GridFTP guide](/data/gridftp#configuring-authentication).

Edit `/etc/sysconfig/xrootd-dsi` to set `XROOTD_VMP` to use your XRootD redirector.

    :::bash
    export XROOTD_VMP="%RED%redirector:1094:/local_path=/remote_path%ENDCOLOR%"

!!! warning
    The syntax of `XROOTD_VMP` is tricky; make sure to use the following guidance:

    - **Redirector**: The hostname and domain of the local XRootD redirector server.
    - **local_path**: The path exported by the GridFTP server.
    - **remote_path**: The XRootD path that will be mounted at **local_path**.

When `xrootd-dsi` is enabled, GridFTP configuration changes should go into `/etc/xrootd-dsi/gridftp-xrootd.conf`, not
`/etc/gridftp.conf`.  
Sites should review any customizations made in the latter and copy them as necessary.

You can use the FUSE mount in order to test POSIX access to xrootd in the GridFTP server.
You should be able to run Unix commands such as `ls /mnt/xrootd` and see the contents of the XRootD server.

For log / config file locations and system services to run, see the [basic GridFTP install](/data/gridftp).

Using XRootD
------------

### Managing XRootD services

Start services on the redirector node before starting any services on the data nodes. 
If you installed only XRootD itself, you will only need to start the `xrootd` service. 
However, if you installed cluster management services, you will need to start `cmsd` as well.

The instructions for starting and stopping an XRootD service depend on whether the service is installed on an EL 6 or EL
7 machine, and whether you are using a standalone or clustered configuration.

On EL 6, which config to use is set in the file `/etc/sysconfig/xrootd`. 
For example, to have `xrootd` use the clustered config, you would have a line such as this:

``` file
XROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-%RED%clustered%ENDCOLOR%.cfg -k fifo"
```

To use the standalone config instead, you would use:

``` file
XROOTD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/xrootd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-%RED%standalone%ENDCOLOR%.cfg -k fifo"
```

On EL 7, which config to use is determined by the service name given to `systemctl`. 
For example, to have `xrootd` use the clustered config, you would start up `xrootd` with this line:

``` console
root@host # systemctl start xrootd@%RED%clustered%ENDCOLOR%
```

To use the standalone config instead, you would use:

``` console
root@host # systemctl start xrootd@%RED%standalone%ENDCOLOR%
```

The services are:


| Service                    | EL 6 service name | EL 7 service name   |
|:---------------------------|:------------------|:--------------------|
| XRootD (standalone config) | `xrootd`          | `xrootd@standalone` |
| XRootD (clustered config)  | `xrootd`          | `xrootd@clustered`  |
| CMSD (clustered config)    | `cmsd`            | `cmsd@clustered`    |

As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as `root`):


| To …                                        | On EL 6, run the command…    | On EL 7, run the command…        |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Start a service                             | `service SERVICE-NAME start` | `systemctl start SERVICE-NAME`   |
| Stop a service                              | `service SERVICE-NAME stop`  | `systemctl stop SERVICE-NAME`    |
| Enable a service to start during boot       | `chkconfig SERVICE-NAME on`  | `systemctl enable SERVICE-NAME`  |
