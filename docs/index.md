OSG Site Administrator Documentation
====================================

Welcome to the home of the Open Science Grid (OSG) Site Administrator documentation!  This documentation aims to
provide OSG site admins with the necessary information to install, configure, and operate site services.

If you are not a site adminstrator:

- If you are a **researcher** interested in using OSG resources, you may want to view our
  [user documentation](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home).
- If you'd like to learn more about the OSG and our mission, visit the OSG consortium's
  [homepage](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/).

This document outlines the overall installation process for an OSG site and provides many links into detailed
installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and similar pages. If you do not see software-related technical
documentation listed here, try the search bar at the top or contacting us at
[help@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org).

Plan the Site
-------------

If you have not done so already, [plan the overall architecture of your OSG site](site-planning).
It is recommended that your plan be sufficiently detailed to include the OSG hosts that are needed and the main software
components for each host.
Be sure to consider [the operating systems that OSG supports](release/supported_platforms). For example, a basic site might include:

| Purpose              | Host                                | Major Software                                           |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute Element (CE) | `osg-ce.example.edu`                | OSG CE, HTCondor Central Manager, etc. (`osg-ce-condor`) |
| Worker Nodes         | `wNNN.cluster.example.edu`          | OSG worker node client (`osg-wn-client`)                 |

Prepare the Batch System
------------------------

The assumption is that you have an existing batch system at your site.
Currently, we support [HTCondor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/),
[LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management), [PBS](http://www.pbsworks.com) and
[TORQUE](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/),
[SGE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine), and [Slurm](http://slurm.schedmd.com) batch systems.

For smaller sites (less than 50 worker nodes), the most common way to add a site to OSG is to install the OSG Compute
Element (CE) on the central host of your batch system.
At such a site - especially if you have minimal time to maintain a CE - you may want to contact
<mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org> to ask about using an OSG-hosted CE instead of running your own.
Before proceeding with an install, be sure that you can submit and successfully run a job from your OSG CE host into
your batch system.

Add OSG Software
----------------

If necessary, provision all OSG hosts that are in your site plan that do not exist yet.
The general steps to installing an OSG site are:

1. Install [OSG Yum Repos](/common/yum) and the [Compute Element software](#installing-and-configuring-the-compute-element)
   on your CE host
1. Install the [Worker Node client](#adding-osg-software-to-worker-nodes) on your worker nodes.
1. Install [optional software](#installing-and-configuring-other-services) to increase the capabilities of your site.

!!! note
    For sites with more than a handful of worker nodes, it is recommended to use some sort of configuration management
    tool to install, configure, and maintain your site.
    While beyond the scope of OSG’s documentation to explain how to select and use such a system, some popular
    configuration management tools are [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com), [Chef](https://www.chef.io),
    [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), and [CFEngine](http://cfengine.com).

### General Installation Instructions ###

### Adding OSG Software to Worker Nodes ###

-   [Worker Node (WN) Client Overview](worker-node/using-wn)
-   Install the WN client software on every worker node – pick a method:
    -   [Using RPMs](worker-node/install-wn) – useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef)
    -   [Using a tarball](worker-node/install-wn-tarball) – useful for installation onto a shared filesystem (does not
        require root access)
    -   [Using OASIS](worker-node/install-wn-oasis) – useful when [CVMFS](worker-node/install-cvmfs) is already mounted
        on your worker nodes
-   (optional) [Install the CernVM-FS client](worker-node/install-cvmfs) to make it easy for user jobs to use needed
    software from OSG's OASIS repositories
-   (optional) [Install singularity on the OSG worker node](worker-node/install-singularity), to allow pilot jobs to
    isolate user jobs.


### Installing and Configuring Other Services ###

All of these node types and their services are optional, although OSG requires an HTTP caching service if you have
installed [CVMFS](worker-node/install-cvmfs) on your worker nodes.

-   [Install Frontier Squid](data/frontier-squid), an HTTP caching proxy service.
-   Storage element:
    -   Existing POSIX-based systems (such as NFS, Lustre, or GPFS):
        -   [Install standalone OSG GridFTP](data/gridftp): GridFTP server
        -   (optional) [Install load-balanced OSG GridFTP](data/load-balanced-gridftp): when a single GridFTP server
            isn't enough
    -   Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):
        -   [Hadoop Overview](data/hadoop-overview): HDFS information, planning, and guides
    -   XRootD:
        -   [XRootd Overview](/data/xrootd/overview): XRootD information, planning, and guides
        -   [Install XRootD Server](/data/xrootd/install-storage-element): XRootD redirector installation
-   RSV monitoring to monitor and report to OSG on the health of your site
    -   [Install RSV](monitoring/install-rsv)
-   [Install the GlideinWMS VO Frontend](other/install-gwms-frontend) if your want your users' jobs to run on the OSG
    -   [Install the RSV GlideinWMS Tester](monitoring/install-rsv-gwms-tester) if you want to test your front-end's
        ability to submit jobs to sites in the OSG

Verify OSG Software
-------------------

Before receiving real OSG work, your site needs to successfully run test jobs from our
[GlideinWMS](http://glideinwms.fnal.gov/) factory and report usage to the [GRACC](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org).


If you haven't already, [register](/common/registration.md) any publicly facing resources with OSG software installed,
including HTCondor-CE, Frontier Squid, GridFTP, and/or XRootD.

### Test locally ###

It is useful to test *manual* submission of jobs from inside and outside of your site through your CE to your batch
system.
If this process does not work manually, it will probably not work for the GlideinWMS pilot factory either.

-   [Test job submission into an HTCondor-CE](compute-element/submit-htcondor-ce)

### Get test jobs ####

To begin running pilots at your site, e-mail <osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu> and ask for test pilots.
Please provide them with the following information:

-   The fully qualified domain name of the CE
-   Resource name
-   Supported OS version of your worker nodes (e.g., EL6, EL7, or both)
-   Support for multicore jobs
-   Maximum job walltime
-   Maximum job memory usage

Once the factory team has enough information, they will start submitting pilots from the test factory to your CE.
Initially, this will be one pilot at a time but once the factory verifies that pilot jobs are running successfully, that
number will be ramped up to 10, then 100.

### Verify reporting and monitoring ###

To verify that your site is correctly reporting to the OSG, check
[OSG's Accounting Portal](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/site-summary) for records of your site reports
(select your site from the drop-down box). If you have enabled the OSG VO, you can also check
<http://flock.opensciencegrid.org/monitoring/condor/sites/all_1day.html>.

Scale Up to Full Production
---------------------------

After successfully running all the pilot jobs that are submitted by the test factory and verifying your site reports,
your site will be deemed production ready.
No action is required on your end, factory operations will start submitting pilot jobs from the production factory.

Maintain the Site
-----------------

To avoid potential issues with OSG job submissions, please [notify us](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org) of major changes
to your site, including:

- Major OS version changes on the worker nodes (e.g., upgraded from EL 6 to EL 7)
- Adding or removing [container support](/worker-node/install-singularity)
- Policy changes regarding maximum walltime or memory usage
- Scheduled or unscheduled [downtimes](/common/registration#how-to-register-downtime)
- [Site topology changes](/common/registration) such as additions, modifications, or retirements
- Changes to site contacts, such as administrative or security staff

It is also important to keep your software and data (e.g., CA and VO client) up-to-date with the
[latest OSG release](/release/notes).
To stay abreast of software releases, we recommend subscribing to the <mailto:osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org> mailing
list.
