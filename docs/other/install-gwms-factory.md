GlideinWMS Factory Installation
===================================

This document describes how to install the Glidein Workflow Managment System (GlideinWMS) Factory instance. 

This document assumes expertise with HTCondor and familiarity with the GlideinWMS software.  It **does not** cover anything but the simplest possible install.   Please consult the [GlideinWMS reference documentation](http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/install.html) for advanced topics, including non-root, non-RPM-based installation.

![GlideinWMS Architecture](/img/simple_diagram.png)

This parts covers these primary components of the GlideinWMS system:
 
 -  **WMS Collector / Schedd**: A set of `condor_collector` and `condor_schedd` processes that allow the submission of pilots to Grid entries.  
 -  **GlideinWMS Factory**: The process submitting the pilots when needed


!!! warning
    We really recommend you to **use the OSG provided Factory and not to install your own**. A [VO Frontend](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/other/install-gwms-frontend/) is sufficient to submit your jobs and to decide scheduling policies. And this will avoid for you the complexity to avoid directly with grid sites. If you really need you own Factory be aware that it is a complex component and may require a non trivial maintenance effort.
    

Before Starting
---------------

Before starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting [the Reference section below](#reference) as needed):

### Requirements

#### Host and OS

   - A host to install the **GlideinWMS Factory** (pristine node). 
   - Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 6 and 7.
   - Root access

The Glidein WMS VO Factory has the following requirements:
   -   **CPU**: 4-8 for a large installation (1 should suffice on a small install)
   -   **RAM**: 4-8GB on a large installation (1GB should suffice for small installs)
   -   **Disk**:  10GB will be plenty sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS.  If you are a large site with need to keep significant history and logs, you may want to allocate 100GB+ to store long histories.

#### Users

The GlideinWMS Factory installation will create the following users unless they are **already created**.

| User | Default uid | Comment |
| :--: | :---------: | :-----: |
| condor | none | HTCondor user (installed via dependencies). |
| gfactory | none | This user runs the GlideinWMS VO factory. |

To verify that the user *gfactory* has *gfactory* as primary group check the output of 

        :::console
        root@host # getent passwd gfactory | cut -d: -f4 | xargs getent group

It should be the `gfactory` group. 

!!! note
    If you get another one, you just need to modify the **PrivSep Kernel configuration file** `/etc/condor/privsep_config` as indicated above and establish the corresponding GID. The lists that you see in this file, specify the IDs of all users and groups that HTCondor jobs may use on the given execute machine. In other words, users and groups that HTCondor will be allowed to act on behalf of.


#### Certificates 

| Certificate | User that owns certificate | Path to certificate |
| :---------: | :------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Host certificate | root | /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem  /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem|

[Here](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/security/host-certs/#host-and-service-certificates) are instructions to request a host certificate.
 
The host **certificate/key** is used for authorization,  however, authorization between the Factory and the GlideinWMS collector is done by file system authentication.


#### Networking

##### Firewalls

It must be on the public internet, with at least one port open to the world; all worker nodes will load data from this node trough HTTP. Note that worker nodes will also need outbound access in order to access this HTTP port. 

Installation Procedure
--------------------------------------------

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

- Ensure the host has a [supported operating system](/release/supported_platforms)
- Obtain root access to the host
- Prepare the [required Yum repositories](/common/yum)
- Install [CA certificates](/common/ca)

### Installing HTCondor

Most required software is installed from the Factory RPM installation. HTCondor is the only exception since there are [many different ways to install it](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/), using the RPM system or not. 
You need to have HTCondor installed before installing the GlideinWMS Factory. If yum cannot find a HTCondor RPM, it will install the dummy **empty-condor** RPM, assuming that you installed HTCondor using a tarball distribution.

If you don't have HTCondor already installed, you can install the HTCondor RPM from the OSG repository:

``` console
root@host # yum install condor.x86_64
```

See [this HTCondor document](htcondor.org) for more information on the different options.

### Installing HTCondor-BOSCO

If you plan to send jobs using [direct batch submission](http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/recipes/batch.html) (aka BOSCO), then you need also the **condor-bosco** package. You'll have to install the package and remove one of its file `/etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config` because it interferes with the Factory configuration.

``` console
root@host # yum install condor-bosco
root@host # rm /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config
root@host # touch /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config
```

### Install GWMS Factory

#### Download and install the Factory RPM

Install the RPM and dependencies (be prepared for a lot of dependencies).

``` console
root@host # yum install glideinwms-factory
```   

This will install the current production release verified and tested by OSG with default HTCondor configuration.
This command will install the GlideinWMS Factory, HTCondor, the OSG client, and all the required dependencies.

If you wish to install a different version of GlideinWMS, add the "--enablerepo" argument to the command as follows:

-   `yum install --enablerepo=osg-testing glideinwms-factory`: The most recent production release, still in testing phase.  This will usually match the current tarball version on the !GlideinWMS home page.  (The osg-release production version may lag behind the tarball release by a few weeks as it is verified and packaged by OSG).  Note that this will also take the osg-testing versions of all dependencies as well.
-   `yum install --enablerepo=osg-upcoming glideinwms-factory`:  The most recent development series release, ie version 3 release.  This has newer features such as cloud submission support, but is less tested.

#### Download HTCondor tarballs

You will need to download HTCondor tarballs for each architecture that **you want to deploy pilots on**.
At this point, GlideinWMS factory does not support pulling HTCondor binaries from your system area.
Suggested is that you put these binaries in `/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor` but any **gfactory** accessible location should suffice.


Configuration Procedure 
-----------------------

After installing the RPM you need to configure the components of the GlideinWMS Factory:

   1. Edit Factory configuration options
   1. Edit HTCondor configuration options
   1. Create a HTCondor grid map file
   1. Reconfigure and Start Factory

## Configuring the Factory

The configuration file is `/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml`.  The next steps will describe each line that you will need to edit for most cases, but you may want to review the whole file to be sure that it is configured correctly.

### Security configuration

In the security section, you will need to provide **each frontend** that is allowed to communicate with the Factory:

       :::xml          
       <security key_length="2048" pub_key="RSA" remove_old_cred_age="30" remove_old_cred_freq="24" reuse_oldkey_onstartup_gracetime="900">
          <frontends>
             <frontend identity="vofrontend_service@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME" name="%ORANGE%vofrontend_sec_name%ENDCOLOR%">
                <security_classes>
                   <security_class name="%RED%frontend_sec_class%ENDCOLOR%" username="frontend" />
                </security_classes>
             </frontend>
          </frontends>
        </security>


These attributes are very important to get exactly right or the frontend will not be trusted.  This should match one of the **factory** and **security** sections of the [Configuring the GlideinWMS Frontend](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/other/install-gwms-frontend/#osg-factory-access) in the following way:

 !!! note
     This is a snippet from the Frontend configuration (for reference), not the Factory that you are configuring now!
 
For the Factory section:
        
        :::xml
        <factory query_expr='((stringListMember("VO", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'>
        ....
           <collectors>
              <collector DN="/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME" 
              comment="Define factory collector globally for simplicity"            
              factory_identity="gfactory@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME" 
              my_identity="%GREEN%username%ENDCOLOR%@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME" 
              node="FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME"/>
           </collectors>
        </factory>

For the security:

        :::xml
        # These lines are from the configuration of v 3.x
        <security classad_proxy="/tmp/vo_proxy" proxy_DN="DN of vo_proxy"
              proxy_selection_plugin="ProxyAll"
              security_name="The security name, this is used by factory"
              sym_key="aes_256_cbc">
              <credentials>
                 <credential absfname="/tmp/pilot_proxy" security_class="frontend"
                 trust_domain="OSG" type="grid_proxy"/>
              </credentials>
        </security>        

            
Note that the identity of the frontend must match what condor authenticates the DN of the frontend to.  In `/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile`, there must be an entry with **vofrontend_service** definition (in this case):

``` file
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=Services\/CN\=Some\ Name\ 834323%ENDCOLOR%$" %GREEN%vofrontend_service%ENDCOLOR%
```

### Entry configuration

Entries are grid endpoints (Compute Elements) that can accept job requests and run pilots (which will run user jobs).
Each needs to be configured to go to a specific gatekeeper.

An example test entry is provided in the GlideinWMS configuration file.  At the very least, you will need to modify the entry line:

      :::xml
      %RED%# These lines are from the configuration of v 3.x%ENDCOLOR%
       <entry name="%RED%ENTRY_NAME%ENDCOLOR%" enabled="True" auth_method="grid_proxy" trust_domain="OSG" 
       gatekeeper="%RED%gatekeeper.domain.tld/jobmanager-type%ENDCOLOR%" gridtype="gt2" rsl="(queue=default)(jobtype=single)"
       schedd_name="%RED%schedd_glideins2@FACTORY_HOSTNAME%ENDCOLOR%" verbosity="std" work_dir="OSG">

You will need to modify the entry **name** and **gatekeeper**.  This will determine the gatekeeper that you access.  Specific gatekeepers often require specific "rsl" attributes that determine the job queue that you are in or other attributes.  Add them in the _rsl_ attribute.  

Also, be sure to distribute your entries across the various HTCondor schedd work managers to balance load.  To see the available schedd use `condor_status -schedd -l | grep Name`.  

Several schedd options are configured by default for you:  *schedd_glideins2, schedd_glideins3, schedd_glideins4, schedd_glideins5*, as well as the default *schedd*. This can be modified in the HTCondor configuration.  Add any specific options, such as limitations on jobs/pilots or glexec/voms requirements in the entry section below the above line.

  !!! warning
      If there is no match between *auth_metod* and *trust_domain* of the entry and the *type* and *trust_domain* listed in one of the [credentials of one of the frontends](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/other/install-gwms-frontend/) using this Factory, then no job can run on that entry.

The Factory must advertise the correct Resource Name of each entry for accounting purposes. Then the Factory must also advertise in the entry all the attributes that will allow to match the query expression used in the frontends connecting to this Factory (e.g. `<factory query_expr='((stringListMember("%PINK%VO%ENDCOLOR%", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'>`) in the [VO frontend configuration document](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/other/install-gwms-frontend/). 

%RED%**NOTE: Keep an eye on this part as we're dealing with singularity.**
Then you must advertise correctly if the site supports **gLExec**. If it does not set *GLEXEC_BIN* to *NONE*, if **gLExec** is installed via OSG set it to **OSG**, otherwise set it to the path of !gLExec.

For example this snippet advertises **GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs** attribute with the supported VO so that can be used with the query above in the VO frontend and says that the resource does not support !gLExec:%ENDCOLOR%


      :::xml
      <entry name="RESOURCE_NAME" ...
         <config>
         ...
            <attrs>
            ...
               <attr name="GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs" const="True" glidein_publish="True" job_publish="True" 
               parameter="True" publish="True" type="string" value="%PINK%VO%ENDCOLOR%"/>
               <attr name="GLEXEC_BIN" const="True" glidein_publish="False" job_publish="False" parameter="True" 
               publish="True" type="string" value="%RED%NONE%ENDCOLOR%"/>
               <attr name="GLIDEIN_Resource_Name" const="True" glidein_publish="True" job_publish="True" 
             parameter="True" publish="True" type="string" value="%RED%SiteNameFromOIM%ENDCOLOR%"/>
           </attrs>


!!! note
    Specially if jobs are sent to OSG resources, it is very important to set the GLIDEIN_Resource_Name and to be consistent with the Resource Name reported in OIM because that name will be used for job accounting in Gratia. It should be the name of the Resource in OIM or the name of the Resource Group (specially if there are many gatekeepers submitting to the same cluster).

**Important:**
More information on options can be found [here](http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html)


### Configuring Tarballs

Each pilot will download HTCondor binaries from the staging area.  Often, multiple binaries are needed to support various architectures and platforms. 
Currently, you will need to provide at least one tarball for GlideinWMS to use.  (Using the system binaries is currently not supported).

Download a HTCondor tarball from [here](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl).  Suggested is to put the binaries in `/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor`, but any factory-accessible location will do just fine.

Once you have downloaded the tarball, configure it in `/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml` like in the following:

      :::xml
         <condor_tarball arch="default" base_dir="/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor/condor-8.7.6-x86_64_RedHat6-stripped" os="rhel6" version="default"/>

Remember also to modify the `condor_os` and `condor_arch` attributes in the entries (the configured Compute Elements) to pick the correct HTCondor binary.
[Here](http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/factory/configuration.html#tarballs) are more details on using multiple HTCondor binaries. Note that is sufficient to set the `base_dir`; the reconfigure command will prepare the tarball and add it to the XML config file.
  
## Configuring HTCondor

The HTCondor configuration for the Factory is placed in `/etc/condor/config.d`.

- 00_gwms_factory_general.config
- 00-restart_peaceful.config
- 01_gwms_factory_collectors.config
- 02_gwms_factory_schedds.config
- 03_gwms_local.config
- 10-batch_gahp_blahp.config

Get rid of the pre-loaded HTCondor default

``` console
root@host # rm /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config
```

For most installations, the items you need to modify are in `03_gwms_factory_local.config`.  The lines you will have to edit are:

   1. Credentials of the machine.  You can either run using a proxy, or a service certificate.  It is recommended to use a host certificate and specify it's location in the 
variables `GSI_DAEMON_CERT` and `GSI_DAEMON_KEY`.  The host certificate should be owned by **root** and have the correct permissions, 600.
   1. HTCondor ids in the form UID.GID (both are integers)
   1. HTCondor admin email it will email when services fail.

``` file
#-- HTCondor user: condor
CONDOR_IDS =
#--  Contact (via email) when problems occur
CONDOR_ADMIN =

############################
# GSI Security config
############################
#-- Grid Certificate directory
GSI_DAEMON_TRUSTED_CA_DIR= /etc/grid-security/certificates

#-- Credentials
GSI_DAEMON_CERT =  /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
GSI_DAEMON_KEY  =  /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem

#-- HTCondor mapfile
CERTIFICATE_MAPFILE= /etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile

###################################
# Whitelist of HTCondor daemon DNs
###################################
#DAEMON_LIST = COLLECTOR, MASTER, NEGOTIATOR, SCHEDD, STARTD
</pre>
``` 

#### Using other HTCondor RPMs, e.g. UW Madison HTCondor RPM

The above procedure will work if you are using the OSG HTCondor RPMS. You can verify that you used the OSG HTCondor RPM by using `yum list condor`. The version name should include "osg", e.g. `8.6.9-1.1.osg34.el7`.

If you are using the UW Madison HTCondor RPMS, be aware of the following changes:

-   This HTCondor RPM uses a file `/etc/condor/condor_config.local` to add your local machine slot to the user pool.
-   If you want to disable this behavior (recommended), you should blank out that file or comment out the line in `/etc/condor/condor_config` for LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE. (Make sure that LOCAL\_CONFIG\_DIR is set to `/etc/condor/config.d`)
-   Note that the variable LOCAL\_DIR is set differently in UW Madison and OSG RPMs. This should not cause any more problems in the Glideinwms RPMs, but please take note if you use this variable in your job submissions or other customizations.

In general if you are using a non OSG RPM or if you added custom configuration files for HTCondor please check the order of the configuration files:

``` console
root@host # condor_config_val -config
Configuration source:
    /etc/condor/condor_config
Local configuration sources:
	/etc/condor/config.d/00-restart_peaceful.config
	/etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_factory_general.config
	/etc/condor/config.d/01_gwms_factory_collectors.config
	/etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_factory_schedds.config
	/etc/condor/config.d/03_gwms_local.config
	/etc/condor/config.d/10-batch_gahp_blahp.config
	/etc/condor/condor_config.local
```

#### Restarting HTCondor

After configuring HTCondor, be sure to restart HTCondor:

    :::console
    root@host # service condor restart


#### Configuring HTCondor Privilege Separation

Lastly, verify the settings in `/etc/condor/privsep_config`.  By default,
the values in this file should not need to be modified.  However,
if your user/group differs from *gfactory* / *gfactory*, or if you are operating
a Factory with multiple frontends, you will have to modify this file.

This file controls the HTCondor root switchboard, which allows the Factory
to change permissions of files, specifically the proxies and files
passed to it by the frontends.

``` file
valid-caller-uids = gfactory
valid-caller-gids = gfactory
valid-target-uids = fecmsucsd : fehcc : fecmscern
valid-target-gids = fecmsucsd : fehcc : fecmscern
valid-dirs = /var/lib/gwms-factory/client-proxies
valid-dirs = /var/lib/gwms-factory/client-logs
valid-dirs = /var/log/gwms-factory/client
valid-dirs = /var/lib/gwms-factory
valid-dirs = /var/log/gwms-factory
procd-executable = /usr/sbin/condor_procd
```

Thus, the *valid-called-uids* and *valid-caller-gids* should match the user/group of your Factory user.
The *valid-target-uids* and *valid-target-gids* should be a colon-separated list of all the frontend
users and groups.  This should match the security_classes section in `/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml`.

## Create a HTCondor grid mapfile.

The HTCondor grid mapfile `/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile` is used for authentication between the glidein running on a remote worker node, and the local collector.  HTCondor uses the mapfile to map certificates to pseudo-users on the local machine.  It is important that you map the DN's of each frontend you are talking to.

Below is an example mapfile, by default found in `/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile`:

``` file
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=People\/CN\=Some\ Name\ 123456$" frontend
GSI (.*) anonymous
FS (.*) \1 
```

Each frontend needs a line that maps to the user specified in the identity argument in the frontend security section of the Factory configuration.

### Reconfiguring GlideinWMS ###

After changing the configuration of GlideinWMS and making sure that Factory is running, use the following table to find the appropriate command for your operating system (run as `root`):

| If your operating system is... | Run the following command...                 |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Enterprise Linux 7             | `systemctl reload gwms-factory` |
| Enterprise Linux 6             | `service gwms-factory reconfig`  |


### Upgrading GlideinWMS ###

Before you start the Factory service first time, you should always use the "upgrade" option. You must issue an upgrade command to GlideinWMS:

    1. Make sure the `condor` and `gwms-factory` services are stopped.

    1. Issue the upgrade command
    
       - **If you are using Enterprise Linux 7**

            :::console
            root@host # /usr/sbin/gwms-factory upgrade

       - **If you are using Enterprise Linux 6**

            :::console
            root@host # service gwms-factory upgrade

    1. Start the `condor` and `gwms-factory` services (see next part).

### Service Activation and Deactivation

To *start the Factory* you must start also **HTCondor** and the **Web server** beside the Factory itself:

        :::console
        # %RED%For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # service condor start
        root@host # service httpd start
        root@host # service gwms-factory start
       
        # %RED% For RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SL7%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # systemctl start condor
        root@host # systemctl start gwms-factory
        
!!! note
    Once you successfully start using the Factory service, anytime you change the `/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml` file and/or some glidein script, you will need to run the following commands:
    
        :::console
        # %RED% For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # service gwms-factory reconfig
        # %RED% And if you change also some code%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # service gwms-factory upgrade
    

        # %RED% But the situation is a bit more complicated in RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SL7 due to systemd restrictions%ENDCOLOR%
        # %GREEN% For reconfig:%ENDCOLOR%
        A. %RED% when the Factory is running%ENDCOLOR%
        A.1 %RED% without any additional options%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # /usr/sbin/gwms-factory reconfig%ENDCOLOR%
        or
        root@host # systemctl reload gwms-factory

        A.2 %RED% if you want to give additional options %ENDCOLOR%
        systemctl stop gwms-factory
        /usr/sbin/gwms-factory reconfig "and your options"
        systemctl start gwms-factory

        B. %RED% when the Factory is NOT running %ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # /usr/sbin/gwms-factory reconfig ("and your options")
	

To enable the services so that they restart after a reboot:

        :::console
        # %RED%# For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on 
        root@host # /sbin/chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on 
        root@host # /sbin/chkconfig condor on
        root@host # /sbin/chkconfig httpd on
        root@host # /sbin/chkconfig gwms-factory on
        # %RED%# For RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SL7%ENDCOLOR%
        root@host # systemctl enable fetch-crl-cron 
        root@host # systemctl enable fetch-crl-boot
        root@host # systemctl enable condor 
        root@host # systemctl enable httpd 
        root@host # systemctl enable gwms-factory

To stop the Factory:

```console
# %RED%For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6 %ENDCOLOR%
root@host # service gwms-factory stop
# %RED%For RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SL7%ENDCOLOR%
root@host # systemctl stop gwms-factory
```  
And you can stop also the other services if you are not using them independently of the Factory.


Validating GlideinWMS Factory
------------------------------

The complete validation of the Factory is the submission of actual jobs.

You can also check that the services are up and running:

```console
root@host # condor_status -any

MyType               TargetType           Name

glidefactoryclient   None                 12345_TEST_ENTRY@gfactory_instance@

- You should have one "glidefactory" classAd for each entry that you have enabled.
If you have already configured the frontends, you will also have one glidefactoryclient and one glideclient classAd for each frontend / entry.

- You can check also the monitoring Web page: `http://YOUR_HOST_FQDN/factory/monitor/`

- You can also test the local submission of a job to a resource using the test script *local_start.sh* but you must first install [OSG client](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/worker-node/install-wn/) and generate a proxy. After that you can run the test (replace ENTRY_NAME with the name of one of the entries in `/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml`):


#### Check Web server configuration for the monitoring

Verify web area and specially the location of your web server:

``` file
 stage base_dir="/var/lib/gwms-factory/web-area/stage" use_symlink="True" web_base_url="http://HOSTNAME:PORT/factory/stage"
 ```
  
**This will determine the location of your web server**.  It is advisable (but not necessarily) to change the port here and in apache by modifying the "Listen" directive in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.  Note that web servers are an often attacked piece of infrastruture, so you may want to go through the Apache configuration in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` and disable unneeded modules.


Troubleshooting GlideinWMS Factory
------------------------------------

### File Locations
|  *File Description*  |  *File Location*  | *Comment*|
|Configuration file | /etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml | Main configuration file |
|Logs | /var/log/gwms-factory/server/factory | Overall server logs |
|| /var/log/gwms-factory/server/entry_NAME | Specific entry logs (generally more useful) |
|| /var/log/gwms-factory/client | Glidein Pilot logs seperated by user and entry.  |
|Startup script | /etc/init.d/gwms-factory ||
|Web Directory | /var/lib/gwms-factory/web-area ||
|Web Base| /var/lib/gwms-factory/web-base ||
|Working Directory | /var/lib/gwms-factory/work-dir/ ||

### Increase the log level and change rotation policies

You can increase the log level of the frontend. To add a log file with all the log information add the following line with all the message types in the `process_log` section of `/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml`:

``` xml
<log_retention>
   <process_logs>
       <process_log extension="all" max_days="7.0" max_mbytes="100.0" min_days="3.0" msg_types="DEBUG,EXCEPTION,INFO,ERROR,ERR"/>
```


You can also change the rotation policy and choose whether compress the rotated files, all in the same section of the config files:

-   max_bytes is the max size of the log files
-   max_days it will be rotated.
-   compression specifies if rotated files are compressed
-   backup_count is the number of rotated log files kept

Further details are in the [reference documentation](http://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/frontend/configuration.html#process_logs).

### Failed authentication errors

If you get messages such as these in the logs, the Factory does not trust the frontend and will not submit glideins.

:::console
WARNING: Client fermicloud128-fnal-gov_OSG_gWMSFrontend.main (secid: frontend_name) not in white list. Skipping request

This error means that the frontend name in the security section of the Factory does not match the `security_name` in the frontend.

:::console
Client fermicloud128-fnal-gov_OSG_gWMSFrontend.main (secid: frontend_name) is not coming from a trusted source;
 AuthenticatedIdentity vofrontend_condor@fermicloud130.fnal.gov!=vofrontend_factory@fermicloud130.fnal.gov. 
Skipping for security reasons.


This error means that the identity in the security section of the Factory does not match what the `/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile` authenticates the frontend to in HTCondor (!Authenticated Identity in the classad).

Make sure the attributes are correctly lined up as in the Frontend security configuration section above.

### Glideins start but do not connect to User pool / VO Frontend

Check the appropriate job err and out logs in `/var/log/gwms-factory/client` to see if any errors were reported.
Often, this will be a pilot unable to access a web server or with an invalid proxy.  Also, verify that the `condor_mapfile` is correct on the VO Frontend's user pool collector and configuration.

### Glideins start but fail before running job with error "Proxy not long lived enough"

If the glideins are running on a resource (entry) but the jobs are not running and the log files in `/var/log/gwms-factory/client/user_frontend/glidein_gfactory_instance/ENTRY_NAME` report an error like "Proxy not long lived enough (86096 s left), shortened retire time ...",  then probably the HTCondor RLM on the Compute Element is delegating the proxy and shortening its lifespan.

This can be fixed by setting `DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS = FALSE` as suggested in the [CE install document](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/#installing-and-configuring-the-compute-element).

### Condor_root_switchboard errors

Make sure that you run `service gwms-factory upgrade` instead of the more light-weight `service gwms-factory reconfig`
to ensure that all scripts are created correctly. Just make sure that gwms-factory is stopped.

Next verify `/etc/condor/privsep_config` to make sure the users and groups are listed correctly.

Lastly, verify that permissions are correct.  The parent directory of all valid-dirs must be owned by root.
