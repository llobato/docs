Updating to the new release
---------------------------

### Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need to [install the current OSG repositories](/common/yum#install-osg-repositories).

### Update Software

Once the repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

``` console
root@host # yum update
```

!!! note "Notes"
    -   Please be aware that running `yum update` may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the `--exclude=[package-name or glob]` option for the `yum` command.
    -   Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a `.rpmnew` file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a `.rpmnew` extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the `.rpmnew` file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the `.rpmnew` extension). Watch especially for `/etc/lcmaps.db`, which every site is expected to edit.
