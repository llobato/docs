==========================

**Release Date**: 2015-12-15

Summary of changes
------------------

This release contains:

-   Fixed a problem in the PKI command line tools where "Certificate Requests" were being rejected by the CILogon Certificate Authority.

These [JIRA tickets](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.3.7%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC) were addressed in this release.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found [here](/index.md)

Known Issues
------------

-   HTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break. In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file:

        :::file
        COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False

-   StashCache packages need to be manually configured
    -   Manual configuration for origin server
        -   Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use:

                :::file
                xrd.port 1094
                all.role server
                all.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213
                all.export / nostage
                xrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect
                ofs.trace none
                xrd.trace conn
                cms.trace all
                sec.protocol  host
                sec.protbind  * none
                all.adminpath /var/run/xrootd
                all.pidpath /var/run/xrootd

-   Manual configuration for cache server
    -   In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare `pss.origin <stash-redirector.example.com>` instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for StashCache is [here](http://opensciencegrid.org/StashCache/admin/configure-cache/).
-   In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from:

        :::file
        CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo"
<br/>

    to

        :::file
        CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo" 

Updating to the new release
---------------------------

### Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need to [install the current OSG repositories](/common/yum#install-osg-repositories).

### Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

``` console
root@host # yum update
```

!!! note "Notes"
    -   Please be aware that running `yum update` may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the `--exclude=[package-name or glob]` option for the `yum` command.
    -   Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a `.rpmnew` file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a `.rpmnew` extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the `.rpmnew` file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the `.rpmnew` extension). Watch especially for `/etc/lcmaps.db`, which every site is expected to edit.
