Known Issues
------------

Due to the central RSV service retirement (see [this document](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/service-migrations-spring-2018/) for details),
the new version of RSV will disable the `gratia-consumer` component that reports to the central service.
Please update _all_ RSV packages by running the following command on your RSV host:

``` console
root@host # yum update rsv\*
```

Additionally, if you are using osg-configure, please edit `/etc/osg/config.d/30-rsv.ini` and set the following:

``` file
enable_gratia = False
```

Updating to the new release
---------------------------

To update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on [updating between release series](/release/release_series#updating-from-osg-31-32-33-to-33-or-34).

### Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need to [install the current OSG repositories](/common/yum#install-osg-repositories).

### Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

``` console
root@host # yum update
```

!!! note "Notes"
    -   Please be aware that running `yum update` may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the `--exclude=[package-name or glob]` option for the `yum` command.
    -   Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a `.rpmnew` file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a `.rpmnew` extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the `.rpmnew` file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the `.rpmnew` extension). Watch especially for `/etc/lcmaps.db`, which every site is expected to edit.
