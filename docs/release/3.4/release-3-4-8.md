OSG Software Release 3.4.8
==========================

**Release Date**: 2018-02-08

Summary of changes
------------------

This release contains:

-   Critical GlideinWMS bug fix for heavily loaded frontends (<https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/issues/18748>)

These [JIRA tickets](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.4.8%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20key%20DESC) were addressed in this release.

!!! note "Notes"
    -   OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.
    -   StashCache is supported on EL7 only.
    -   xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.
    -   OSG PKI tools now create service certificate files where the service tag is separated from the hostname with an underscore (`_`). This new format first appeared in OSG PKI tools version 2.1.2.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found [here](/index.md).

Known Issues
------------

-   Because the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: `WARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details`. This warning can safely be ignored.

Updating to the new release
---------------------------

To update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on [updating between release series](/release/release_series#updating-from-osg-31-32-33-to-33-or-34).

### Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need to [install the current OSG repositories](/common/yum#install-osg-repositories).

### Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

``` console
root@host # yum update
```

!!! note "Notes"
    -   Please be aware that running `yum update` may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the `--exclude=[package-name or glob]` option for the `yum` command.
    -   Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a `.rpmnew` file being created. That means that a configuration file had been edited, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the edited configuration file but instead installs the new version with a `.rpmnew` extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the `.rpmnew` file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the `.rpmnew` extension). Watch especially for `/etc/lcmaps.db`, which every site is expected to edit.
