OSG Software Supported Operating Systems
==========================================

The OSG Software 3.4 release series is supported on Red Hat Enterprise 6 and 7 and compatible platforms,
for 64-bit Intel architectures.

OSG also supports select rebuilds of RHEL.  Specifically:

-   CentOS 6
-   CentOS 7
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
-   Scientific Linux 6
-   Scientific Linux 7

OSG builds and tests its RPMs on the latest releases of the relevant platforms (e.g., in 2018, the RHEL 7 builds were based on RHEL 7.5).
Older releases of the OS may not receive thorough testing and have subtle bugs; we may ask sites to update to the latest OS packages
as part of the support process.

The OSG Software 3.3 release series was supported on Red Hat Enterprise 6 (32-bit and 64-bit) and 7 (64-bit only) and compatible
platforms.  Support for this release series (including security patches) ended in May 2018.  If you need help migrating from OSG 3.3,
please contact support@opensciencegrid.org.
