Host Certificates
=================

!!! note
    This document describes how to get **host** certificates.
    For instructions on how to get **user** certificates, see the [User Certificates document](user-certs.md).

Host certificates are [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) that are used to securely identify
servers and to establish encrypted connections between services and clients.
In the OSG, some grid resources (e.g., HTCondor-CE, XRootD, GridFTP) require host certificates.
If you are unsure if your host needs a host certificate, please consult the installation instructions for the software
you are interested in installing.

To acquire a host certificate, you must submit a request to a Certificate Authority (CA).
We recommend requesting host certificates from one of the following CAs:

- [InCommon IGTF](#requesting-incommon-igtf-host-certificates):
  an IGTF-accredited CA for services that interact with the WLCG;
  requires a subscription, generally held by an institution

    !!! important
        For integration with the OSG, InCommon host certificates must be issued by the
        [IGTF CA](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/ICCS/InCommon+Cert+Types#InCommonCertTypes-IGTFServerCertificates)
        and not the InCommon RSA CA.

- [Let's Encrypt](#requesting-host-certificates-using-lets-encrypt):
  a free, automated, and open CA frequently used for web services;
  see the [security team's position on Let's Encrypt](https://opensciencegrid.org/security/LetsEncryptOSGCAbundle/)
  for more details.
  Let's Encrypt is not IGTF-accredited so their certificates are not suitable for WLCG services.

If neither of the above options work for your site, the OSG also accepts all
[IGTF-accredited CAs](https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/cadist/).

Before Starting
---------------

Before requesting a new host certificate, use `openssl` to check if your host already has a valid certificate, i.e. the
present is between `notBefore` and `notAfter` dates and times.
If so, you may safely skip this document:

``` console
user@host $ openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout
subject= /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=host.opensciencegrid.org
issuer=/DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=CILogon/CN=CILogon OSG CA 1
notBefore=Jan  4 21:08:09 2010 GMT
notAfter=Jan  4 21:08:09 2011 GMT
```

If you are using OpenSSL 1.1, you may notice minor formatting differences.

Requesting InCommon IGTF Host Certificates
------------------------------------------

Many institutions in the United States already subscribe to InCommon and offer IGTF certificate services.
If your institution is in the list of [InCommon subscribers](https://www.incommon.org/certificates/subscribers.html),
continue with the instructions below.
If your institution is not in the list, Let's Encrypt certificates do not meet your needs, and you do not have access to
another IGTF CA subscription, please [contact us](/common/help.md).

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

- Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](/release/supported_platforms)
- Obtain root access to the host
- Prepare the [required Yum repositories](/common/yum)

From a host that meets the above requirements, there are two options to get InCommon IGTF-accredited host certificates:

1. [Requesting certificates from a Registration Authority (RA)](#requesting-certificates-from-a-registration-authority):
   This requires a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which can be generated with the `osg-cert-request` tool.
1. [Requesting certificates as an RA](#requesting-certificates-as-a-registration-authority):
   As an RA, you can request, approve, and retrieve certificates yourself through the InCommon REST API using the
   `osg-incommon-cert-request` tool .

Install the `osg-pki-tools` where both command line tools are available:

```console
root@host # yum install osg-pki-tools
```

### Requesting certificates from a registration authority

1. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and private key using the `osg-cert-request` tool:

        :::console
        user@host $ osg-cert-request --hostname <HOSTNAME> \
                     --country <COUNTRY> \
                     --state <STATE> \
                     --locality <LOCALITY> \
                     --organization <ORGANIZATION>

    You may also add [DNS Subject Alternative Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) (SAN) to
    the request by specifying any number of `--altname <SAN>`.
    For example, the following generates a CSR for `test.opensciencegrid.org` with `foo.opensciencegrid.org` and
    `bar.opensciencegrid.org` as SANs:

        :::console
        user@host $ osg-cert-request --hostname test.opensciencegrid.org \
                     --country US \
                     --state Wisconsin \
                     --locality Madison \
                     --organization 'University of Wisconsin' \
                     --altname foo.opensciencegrid.org \
                     --altname bar.opensciencegrid.org

    If successful, the CSR will be named `<HOSTNAME>.req` and the private key will be named `<HOSTNAME>-key.pem`.
    Additional options and descriptions can be found [here](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-pki-tools#options).

1. Find your institution-specific InCommon contact
   (e.g. [UW-Madison InCommon contact](https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/strategic-operations-departments-people/cybersecurity/security-tools-software/server-certificates)
   submit the CSR that you generated above, and request a 1-year `IGTF Server Certificate` for `OTHER` server software.
1. After the certificate has been issued by your institution, download the host certificate only (not the full chain) to
   its intended host and copy over the key you generated above.
1. Verify that the issuer `CN` field is ` InCommon IGTF Server CA`:

        :::console
        $ openssl x509 -in %RED%<PATH TO CERTIFICATE>%ENDCOLOR% -noout -issuer
        issuer= /C=US/O=Internet2/OU=InCommon/CN=InCommon IGTF Server CA

1. Install the host certificate and key:

        :::console
        root@host # cp %RED%<PATH TO CERTIFICATE>%ENDCOLOR% /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
        root@host # chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
        root@host # cp %RED%<PATH TO KEY>%ENDCOLOR% /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
        root@host # chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem

### Requesting certificates as a registration authority

If you are a Registration Authority for your institution, skip ahead to [this section](#osg-incommon-cert-request).
If you are not already a Registration Authority (RA) for your institution, you must request to be made one:

1. Find your institution-specific InCommon contact
   (e.g. [UW-Madison InCommon contact](https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/strategic-operations-departments-people/cybersecurity/security-tools-software/server-certificates)),
1. Request a Department Registration Authority user with SSL auto-approve enabled and a client certificate:
    - If they do not grant your request, you will not be able to request, approve, and retrieve certificates yourself.
      Instead, you must [request certificates from your RA](#requesting-certificates-from-a-registration-authority).
    - If they grant your request, you will receive an email with instructions for requesting your client certificate.
      Download the `.p12` file and extract the certificate and key:

            :::console
            user@host $ openssl pkcs12 -in incommon_file.p12 -nocerts -out ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_key.pem
            user@host $ openssl pkcs12 -in incommon_file.p12 -nokeys -out ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_cert.pem

1. Find your institution-specific organization and department codes at the InCommon Cert Manager (https://cert-manager.com/customer/InCommon).
   These are numeric codes that should be specified through the command line using the -O/--orgcode ORG,DEPT option:

    * Organization code is shown as OrgID under Settings > Organizations > Edit
    * Department code is shown as OrgID under Settings > Organizations > Departments > Edit

Once you have RA privileges, you may request, approve, and retrieve host certificates using `osg-incommon-cert-request`:

<a name="osg-incommon-cert-request"></a>

- Requesting a certificate with a single hostname `<HOSTNAME>`:

        :::console
        user@host $ osg-incommon-cert-request --username <INCOMMON_LOGIN> \
                    --cert ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_cert.pem \
                    --pkey ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_key.pem \ 
                    --hostname <HOSTNAME>
                    [--orgcode <ORG,DEPT>]

- Requesting a certificate with Subject Alternative Names (SANs):

        :::console
        user@host $ osg-incommon-cert-request --username <INCOMMON_LOGIN> \
                    --cert ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_cert.pem \
                    --pkey ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_key.pem \
                    --hostname <HOSTNAME> \
                    --altname <ALTNAME> \
                    --altname <ALTNAME2>
                    [--orgcode <ORG,DEPT>]

- Requesting certificates in bulk using a hostfile name:

        :::console
        user@host $ osg-incommon-cert-request --username <INCOMMON_LOGIN> \
                    --cert ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_cert.pem \
                    --pkey ~/path_to_dir/incommon_user_key.pem \
                    --hostfile ~/path_to_file/hostfile.txt \
                    [--orgcode <ORG,DEPT>]

    Where the contents of `hostfile.txt` contain one hostname and any number of SANs per line:

        :::console
        hostname01.yourdomain
        hostname02.yourdomain hostnamealias.yourdomain hostname03.yourdomain
        hostname04.yourdomain hostname05.yourdomain


Requesting Host Certificates Using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, automated, and open CA frequently used for web services;
see the [security team's position on Let's Encrypt](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/security/LetsEncryptOSGCAbundle/)
for more details.
Let's Encrypt can be used to obtain host certificates as an alternative to InCommon if your institution does not have
an InCommon subscription.

1. Install the `certbot` package (available from the EPEL 7 repository):

        :::console
        root@host # yum install certbot

1. If you have any service running on port 80, you will have to disable it temporarily to obtain certificates, as Let's
   Encrypt needs to bind on it temporarily in order to verify the host.
   For instance, if you already have an HTCondor-CE set up with the
   [HTCondor-CE View service](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/compute-element/install-htcondor-ce/#install-and-run-the-htcondor-ce-view)
   running, stop the HTCondor-CE View service, as it listens on port 80.

1. Run the following command to obtain the host certificate with Let's Encrypt:

        :::console
        root@host # certbot certonly --standalone --email %RED%<ADMIN_EMAIL>%ENDCOLOR% -d %RED%<HOST>%ENDCOLOR%

1. Set up hostcert/hostkey links:

        :::console
        root@host # ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/cert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
        root@host # ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/privkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
        root@host # chmod 0600 /etc/letsencrypt/archive/*/privkey*.pem


### Renewing Let's Encrypt host certificates ###

Before the host certificate expires, you can renew it with the following command:

``` console
root@host # certbot renew
```

!!!note
   Renewing a certificate requires you to temporarily disable services running on port 80 so that
   certbot can bind to it to verify the host.

To automate the renewal process, you need to choose between using a cron job (SL6 and SL7 hosts) and a systemd timer
(SL7 hosts only).
The two sections below outline both methods for automatically renewing your certificate.


#### Automating renewals using cron

To automate a monthly renewal with a cron job; you can create `/etc/cron.d/certbot-renew` with the following
contents:

``` console
* * 1 * * root certbot renew
```

#### Automating renewals using systemd timers

To automate a monthly  renewal using systemd, you'll need to create two files.
The first is a service file that tells systemd how to invoke certbot.
The second is to generate a timer file that tells systemd how often to run the service.
The steps to setup the timer are as follows:

1. Create a service file called `/etc/systemd/system/certbot.service` with the following contents

        :::file
        [Unit]
        Description=Let's Encrypt renewal

        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=/usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --agree-tos

1. Once the certbot service is working correctly, you will need to create the timer file.
   Create the timer file at `/etc/systemd/system/certbot.timer`) with the following contents:

        :::file
        [Unit]
        Description=Twice daily renewal of Let's Encrypt's certificates

        [Timer]
        OnCalendar=0/12:00:00
        RandomizedDelaySec=1h
        Persistent=true

        [Install]
        WantedBy=timers.target

1. Update the systemd manager configuration:

        :::console
        root@host # systemctl daemon-reload

1. Start and enable the certbot service and timer:

        :::console
        root@host # systemctl start certbot.service
        root@host # systemctl enable certbot.service
        root@host # systemctl start certbot.timer
        root@host # systemctl enable certbot.timer

You can verify that the timer is active by running `systemctl list-timers`.

!!! note
    Verify that the service has started correctly by running `systemctl status certbot.service`. The timer may fail 
    without warnings if the service does not run correctly.

Requesting Service Certificates
-------------------------------

Previously, the OSG recommended using separate X.509 certificates, called "service certificates", for each grid service
on a host.
This practice has become less popular as sites have separated SSL-requiring services to their own hosts.

In the case where your host is only running a single service that requires a service certificate, we recommend using
your [host certificate](#host-certificates) as your service certificate.
Ensure that the ownership of the host certificate and key are appropriate for the service you are running.

If you are running multiple services that require host certificates, we recommend requesting a certificate whose
CommonName is `<service>-hostname` and has the hostname in the list of subject alternative names.

Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------

### Can I use any host to request a certificate for a different host? 

YES, you can use any host to create a certificate signing request as long as the hostname for the certificate is a fully
qualified domain name.

### How do I renew a host certificate? 

For Let's Encrypt certificates, see [this section](#renewing-lets-encrypt-host-certificates)

For other certificates, there is no separate renewal procedure.
Instead, request a new certificate using one of the methods above.

### How can I check if I have a host certificate installed already? 

By default the host certificate key pair will be installed in `/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem` and
`/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem`.
You can use `openssl` to access basic information about the certificate:

``` console
root@host # openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -issuer -dates -noout
subject= /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=host.opensciencegrid.org
issuer= /DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=CILogon/CN=CILogon OSG CA 1
notBefore=Apr  8 00:00:00 2013 GMT
notAfter=May 17 12:00:00 2014 GMT
```

### How can I check the expiration time of my installed host certificate? 

Use the following `openssl` command to find the dates that your host certificate is valid:

``` console
root@host # openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -dates -noout
notBefore=Jan  4 21:08:41 2010 GMT
notAfter=Jan  4 21:08:41 2011 GMT
```
