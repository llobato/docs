Install Singularity
===================

[Singularity](http://sylabs.io/singularity) is a tool that creates
docker-like process containers but without giving extra privileges to
unprivileged users.  It is used by grid pilot jobs (which are
submitted by per-VO grid workload management systems) to isolate user
jobs from the pilot's files and processes and from other users' files
and processes.  It also supplies a chroot environment in order to run
user jobs in different operating system images under one Linux kernel.

Kernels with a version 3.10.0-957 or newer include a feature that allows
singularity to run completely unprivileged. This kernel version is the
default for RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux 7.6 and is available as a
security update for previous 7.x releases.  Although the feature is
available, it needs to be enabled to be usable (instructions below).
This kernel version is not available for RHEL 6 and derivatives.

Without this kernel version, singularity must be installed and run with
setuid-root executables. Singularity keeps the privileged code to a
[minimum](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/introduction.html#security-and-privilege-escalation)
in order to reduce the potential for vulnerabilities.

The OSG has installed singularity in [OASIS](/worker-node/install-cvmfs),
so many sites will eventually (after it is supported by VOs) not need to
install singularity locally if they enable it to run unprivileged.
Meanwhile an RPM installation can be configured to be unprivileged or
privileged.

!!! danger "Kernel vs. Userspace Security"
    Enabling unprivileged user namespaces increases the risk to the
    kernel. However, the kernel is more widely reviewed than singularity and
    the additional capability given to users is more limited.
    OSG Security considers the non-setuid, kernel-based method to have a
    lower security risk.

The document is intended for system administrators that wish to install
and/or configure singularity.

Before Starting
---------------

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host)
steps to prepare in advance:

- Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](/release/supported_platforms)
- Obtain root access to the host
- Prepare the [required Yum repositories](/common/yum)

In addition, this is highly recommended for image distribution:

- Install [CVMFS](/worker-node/install-cvmfs)

Choosing Unprivileged vs Privileged Singularity
-----------------------------------------------

There are two sets of instructions on this page:

- [Enabling Unprivileged Singularity](#enabling-unprivileged-singularity)
- [Singularity via RPM](#singularity-via-rpm)

OSG VOs are working to support running singularity directly from OASIS,
the OSG Software [CVMFS distribution](install-cvmfs), when unprivileged
singularity is enabled.  At that point sites will not have to install
the singularity RPM themselves.  As of April 2019, no VO in the OSG is
yet ready to do this, but OSG recommends that all RHEL 7.x installations
enable support for unprivileged singularity and for now also install the
RPM.  Sites may also choose to configure their RHEL 7.x RPM
installations to run unprivileged.  RHEL 6.x installations have no
option for unprivileged singularity so there the RPM has to be installed
and left configured as privileged.

In addition to improved security, unprivileged singularity enables
`condor_ssh_to_job` to enter a container namespace without itself
needing privileges.  Also, unprivileged singularity enables nesting
containers within another container (when the outer container is started
by singularity 3.x, which is currently in the osg-upcoming repository).

On the other hand, there are a few rare use cases that require
singularity to run privileged:

1. **Using single-file container images.**  Some systems, especially
    High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, deal poorly with
    collections of small files.  In this case, container images stored
    in a single file (as opposed to an unpacked directory) may be
    needed.

    However, known images from OSG VOs are directory-based, and we
    [recommend disabling this feature](#limiting-image-types) on
    privileged installations in order to avoid potential kernel
    exploits.

1. **The overlay feature.**  The "overlay" feature of singularity uses
    overlayfs to add bind mounts where mount points don't exist in the
    underlying image.

    However, this feature doesn't work if the image is a directory
    distributed in CVMFS, singularity has an "underlay" feature that is
    equivalent which does work with CVMFS and does not require
    privileges, and the overlay feature has been a source of security
    vulnerabilities in the past.  For these reasons, [we recommend
    replacing overlay with underlay](#configuring-singularity) even on
    privileged installations.

1. **Allocating new pseudo-tty devices.**  Support for allocating
    pseudo-tty devices was accidentally left out of the user namespace
    support in the RHEL 7.6 kernel.

    However, this feature is only required for a small number of
    applications, and singularity 3.x works around the limitation for
    most of them without needing privileges.


Enabling Unprivileged Singularity
---------------------------------

The instructions in this section are for enabling singularity to run
unprivileged.

If the operating system is an EL 7 variant and has been updated to the EL
7.6 kernel or later, enable unprivileged singularity with the following
steps:

1. Enable user namespaces via `sysctl`:

        :::console
        root@host # echo "user.max_user_namespaces = 15000" \
            > /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf
        root@host # sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf

1. (Optional) Disable network namespaces:

        :::console
        root@host # echo "user.max_net_namespaces = 0" \
            > /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf
        root@host # sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf

    OSG VOs do not need network namespaces with singularity, and
    disabling them reduces the risk profile of enabling user
    namespaces.

    Network namespaces are, however, utilized by other software,
    such as Docker.  Disabling network namespaces may break
    other software, or limit its capabilities (such as
    requiring the `--net=host` option in Docker).

1. If you haven't yet installed [CVMFS](install-cvmfs), do so.


### Validating Unprivileged Singularity ###

Once you have the host configured properly, log in as an ordinary
unprivileged user and verify that singularity in OASIS works:

```console
user@host $ /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/singularity/bin/singularity \
                exec --contain --ipc --pid --bind /cvmfs \
                /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo:el6 \
                ps -ef
WARNING: Container does not have an exec helper script, calling 'ps' directly
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
user         1     0  2 21:27 ?        00:00:00 shim-init
user         2     1  0 21:27 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
```


Singularity via RPM
-------------------

The instructions in this section are for the singularity RPM, which 
includes setuid-root executables.  The setuid-root executables can
however be disabled by configuration, details below.

### Installing Singularity via RPM ###

To install the singularity RPM, make sure that your host is up to date
before installing the required packages:

1. Clean yum cache:

        ::console
        root@host # yum clean all --enablerepo=*

1. Update software:

        :::console
        root@host # yum update

    This command will update **all** packages

1. The singularity packages are split into two parts, choose the command
that corresponds to your situation:
    - If you are installing singularity on a worker node, where images
      do not need to be created or manipulated, install just the smaller
      part to limit the amount of setuid-root code that is installed:

            :::console
            root@host # yum install singularity-runtime

    - If you want a full singularity installation, run the following command:

            :::console
            root@host # yum install singularity

!!! tip
    In most cases, only `singularity-runtime` is needed on the worker node;
    installing only this smaller package reduces risk of potential security
    exploits, especially when running in privileged mode.

### Configuring Singularity ###

The OSG distribution of singularity includes an option called
`underlay` that enables using bind mount points that do not exist in
the container image.
It is not enabled by default but recommended because it is less
vulnerable to security problems than the similar default `overlay`
option.
In addition, the `overlay` option does not work on RHEL6, does not
work correctly on RHEL7 when container images are distributed by CVMFS,
and does not work in unprivileged mode.

Set these options in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`:

        enable overlay = no
        enable underlay = yes

!!! warning
    If you modify `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`, be careful with
    your upgrade procedures.
    RPM will not automatically merge your changes with new upstream
    configuration keys, which may cause a broken install or inadvertently
    change the site configuration.  Singularity changes its default
    configuration file more frequently than typical OSG software.

    Look for `singularity.conf.rpmnew` after upgrades and merge in any
    changes to the defaults.

#### Configuring the RPM to be Unprivileged ####

If you choose to run the RPM unprivileged, after
[enabling unprivileged singularity](#enabling-unprivileged-singularity),
change the line in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` that says
`allow setuid = yes` to

        allow setuid = no

Note that the setuid-root executables stay installed, but they will exit
very early if invoked when the configuration file disallows setuid, so
the risk is very low.  There are non-setuid equivalent executables that
are used instead when setuid is disallowed.

#### Limiting Image Types ####

A side effect of disabling privileged singularity is that loopback
mounts are disallowed.  If the installation is privileged, also consider
the following.

Images based on loopback devices carry an inherently higher exposure to
unknown kernel exploits compared to directory-based images distributed via
CVMFS.  See [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/) for further
discussion.

The loopback-based images are the default image type produced by singularity
users and are common at sites with direct user logins.  However (as of April
2019) we are only aware of directory-based images being used by OSG VOs.
Hence, it is reasonable to disable the loopback-based images by setting
the following option in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`:

        max loop devices = 0

While reasonable for some sites, this is not required as there are currently
no public kernel exploits for this issue; any exploits are patched by
Red Hat when they are discovered.

### Validating Singularity RPM ###

After singularity is installed, as an ordinary user run the following
command to verify it:

```console
user@host $ singularity exec --contain --ipc --pid --bind /cvmfs \
                /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo:el6 \
                ps -ef
WARNING: Container does not have an exec helper script, calling 'ps' directly
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
user         1     0  1 21:41 ?        00:00:00 shim-init
user         2     1  0 21:41 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
```

singularity has no services to start or stop.
